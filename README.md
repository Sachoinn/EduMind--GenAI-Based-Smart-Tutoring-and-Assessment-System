# EduMind--GenAI-Based-Smart-Tutoring-and-Assessment-System
EduMind is an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize personalized learning.  
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI to assess student knowledge,  
identify weak areas, and deliver intelligent tutoring feedback — bridging the gap between learning and evaluation.

EduMind is divided into two major phases:

Phase 1: Smart Assessment System
A Python-based NLP module that asks domain-specific questions (e.g., Data Structures, Algorithms, DBMS),  
analyzes user answers using n-gram similarity, and identifies weak concepts based on topic-wise performance.

Phase 2: GenAI Tutoring System
The next phase integrates Generative AI tutoring systems
to provide personalized learning support and targeted explanations for identified weak areas.


System Workflow

1. User Login / Start Quiz 
   → Students begin a adaptive assessment.  
2. Answer Evaluation 
   → Each answer is compared with the correct one using n-gram NLP similarity.  
3. Concept Mapping 
   → System classifies responses topic-wise.  
4. Performance Analytics 
   → Topic-wise scores and weak areas are displayed in a summary.  
5. Gen AI Tutoring  
   → GenAI tutor generates personalized learning content and follow-up questions.
